The second interview was some time in December and it was through a video call. It took about 30-45 minutes to answer all the questions. The questions were a bit harder and you had to go into more detail. Again, the conversation was laid back and very casual. The interviewers I had really just wanted the best from me. I was also sick during the interview and didn't know half the things I was saying, but they were very understanding about that.",
